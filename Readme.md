## HiPS file generation

Useful resources:

* [HiPS in 10 steps](https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/hips/HipsIn10Steps.gml) - basics of HiPS generation
* [Hipsgen manual](https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr/hips/HipsgenManual.pdf) 

HiPS generation requires ```Aladin.jar``` (provided in this repository).

To generate HiPS with default options run a command:
```java -Xmx16g -jar AladinBeta.jar -hipsgen in=Data out=PilotHiPS id=HiPSID```
Notes:
* ```-Xmx16g``` defines memory allocation (16Gb)
* ```inData``` is a directory with files to convert (tiles in single band)
* ```out``` is a name of output directory
* ```id``` matters more if we want to add HiPS to public pool

Other options that might be useful:
* ```blank=0``` - this parameters is set to ```null``` by default. Switching it to 0 makes hipsgen to switch all zero values with null and make the image transparent where there is no scientific data.
* ```"dataRange=-0.1 0.1"``` - defines useful data range
* ```"pixelCut=min max [fct]"``` parameter allows to explicitly indicate the range of original values to be taken into account and the "transfer function" to be applied to obtain the 255 possible values of the compressed tiles: log, sqrt, linear (default), asinh, pow2. 
* ```color=jpeg``` generate JPEGs instead of PNGs (default).


## AladinLite API basics

Useful resources:

## Development

We are using a [dedicated JupyterHub instance that can be launched here ðŸ”’](https://jupyter.skyviewer.ncsa.illinois.edu/) for development of the SkyViewer source code.

One of the reasons we are developing this way is that the JupyterHub instance already [includes a mounted volume from the high-capacity Taiga storage system](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/blob/main/charts/jupyterhub/values.yaml). The data files can be generated via JupyterLab and served by an independent [NGINX webserver](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/blob/main/charts/skyviewer/templates/deployment.yaml) *in situ*.

The [JupyterLab server image is a custom build](./Dockerfile) that includes the required development libraries and tools.

## Deployment

The NCSA SkyViewer web app is deployed [ðŸ”’ via ArgoCD](https://spt3g.ncsa.illinois.edu/argo-cd/applications/skyviewer) on our SPT-3G Kubernetes cluster. There is [a Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/tree/main/charts/skyviewer) driving [the ArgoCD Application](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/blob/main/apps/spt3g/templates/skyviewer.yaml).

The JupyterHub instance is also deployed [ðŸ”’ via ArgoCD](https://spt3g.ncsa.illinois.edu/argo-cd/applications/jupyterhub-skyviewer), using [this Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/tree/main/charts/jupyterhub) that drive [this ArgoCD Application](https://gitlab.com/spt3g/kubernetes/-/blob/main/apps/spt3g/templates/jupyterhub.yaml).

## Access control

### SkyViewer web app

The SkyViewer ArgoCD Application referenced in the Deployment section includes an instance of [OAuth2-Proxy](https://gitlab.com/decentci/charts/-/tree/main/charts/oauth2-proxy-traefik), which provides a lightweight middleware to secure arbitrary ingress routes. In this case, it is configured to authenticate visitors using [the "caps" realm of our SPT-3G project Keycloak server](https://keycloak.spt3g.ncsa.illinois.edu/realms/caps/). Access to the SkyServer web app at https://skyviewer.ncsa.illinois.edu/map/ is limited to members of the Keycloak group `/caps/skyviewer` as configured in its ArgoCD Application linked above.

### JupyterLab server

Access to the JupyterHub service requires membership in the group `/caps/jupyterhub` in [the "caps" realm of our SPT-3G project Keycloak server](https://keycloak.spt3g.ncsa.illinois.edu/realms/caps/). Membership in the group `/caps/jupyterhub/admin` grants users access to the [ðŸ”’ JupyterHub admin control panel](https://jupyter.skyviewer.ncsa.illinois.edu/hub/admin).
